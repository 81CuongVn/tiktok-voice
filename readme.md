# TikTok Text-to-speech API

This is a simple Python program that accesses the TikTok API and gives you an `.mp3` file with what it says in the specified voice.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed of course
2. Run `py main.py` (Windows) or `python3 main.py` (Else)
3. Input a voice (see below for options)
4. Enter the text you would like said
5. Check the script directory for a `voice.mp3` file
